In today’s data-driven business environment, organizations constantly struggle to extract valuable insights from large SQL databases. Traditionally, this process requires writing complex SQL queries, transforming datasets, and building visualization dashboards—tasks that demand significant time, technical expertise, and specialized skills.

With the rise of AI and natural language processing, the way we interact with databases is rapidly evolving. Instead of needing to understand intricate SQL syntax, users can now ask questions in plain language—such as “Show me last year’s revenue trends” or “Which products are most frequently returned?”—and receive immediate, visualized results.

This project walks you through building an AI-powered system that translates natural language into MySQL queries, enabling seamless data exploration and making analytics accessible to every member of your organization.
